.SH NAME
unescape - unescape()
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f[I](deprecated)\f[R]
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] \f[CR]unescape()\f[R] is a non-standard function
implemented by browsers and was only standardized for cross-engine
compatibility.
It is not required to be implemented by all JavaScript engines and may
not work everywhere.
Use \f[CR]decodeURIComponent()\f[R] or \f[CR]decodeURI()\f[R] if
possible.
.RE
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]unescape()\f[B]\f[R] function computes a new string in
which hexadecimal escape sequences are replaced with the characters that
they represent.
The escape sequences might be introduced by a function like
\f[CR]escape()\f[R].

.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]str\f[R]
A string to be decoded.
.SS Return value
A new string in which certain characters have been unescaped.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CR]unescape()\f[R] is a function property of the global object.
.PP
The \f[CR]unescape()\f[R] function replaces any escape sequence with the
character that it represents.
Specifically, it replaces any escape sequence of the form \f[CR]%XX\f[R]
or \f[CR]%uXXXX\f[R] (where \f[CR]X\f[R] represents one hexadecimal
digit) with the character that has the hexadecimal value
\f[CR]XX\f[R]/\f[CR]XXXX\f[R].
If the escape sequence is not a valid escape sequence (for example, if
\f[CR]%\f[R] is followed by one or no hex digit), it is left as-is.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] This function was used mostly for URL
encoding (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_encoding) and is partly
based on the escape format in RFC 1738.
The \f[CR]unescape()\f[R] function does \f[I]not\f[R] evaluate escape
sequences in string literals.
You can replace \f[CR]\[rs]xXX\f[R] with \f[CR]%XX\f[R] and
\f[CR]\[rs]uXXXX\f[R] with \f[CR]%uXXXX\f[R] to get a string that can be
handled by \f[CR]unescape()\f[R].
