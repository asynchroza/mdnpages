.SH NAME
FetchEvent.handled \- FetchEvent: handled property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]handled\f[B]\f[R] property of the \f[CR]FetchEvent\f[R]
interface returns a promise indicating if the event has been handled by
the fetch algorithm or not.
This property allows executing code after the browser has consumed a
response, and is usually used together with the \f[CR]waitUntil()\f[R]
method.
.SH VALUE
A \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that is pending while the event has not been
handled, and fulfilled once it has.

.EX
addEventListener(\[dq]fetch\[dq], (event) => {
  event.respondWith(
    (async function () {
      const response = await doCalculateAResponse(event.request);

      event.waitUntil(
        (async function () {
          await doSomeAsyncStuff(); // optional

          // Wait for the event to be consumed by the browser
          await event.handled;

          return doFinalStuff(); // Finalize AFTER the event has been consumed
        })(),
      );
