.SH Synopsis
.PP
A \f[B]\f[VB]FinalizationRegistry\f[B]\f[R] object lets you request a
callback when a value is garbage-collected.
.SH Description
.PP
\f[V]FinalizationRegistry\f[R] provides a way to request that a
\f[I]cleanup callback\f[R] get called at some point when a value
registered with the registry has been \f[I]reclaimed\f[R]
(garbage-collected).
(Cleanup callbacks are sometimes called \f[I]finalizers\f[R].)
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Cleanup callbacks should not be used for essential
program logic.
See Notes on cleanup callbacks for details.
.RE
.PP
You create the registry passing in the callback:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
const registry = new FinalizationRegistry((heldValue) => {
  // \&...
});
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Then you register any value you want a cleanup callback for by calling
the \f[V]register\f[R] method, passing in the value and a \f[I]held
value\f[R] for it:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
registry.register(target, \[dq]some value\[dq]);
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The registry does not keep a strong reference to the value, as that
would defeat the purpose (if the registry held it strongly, the value
would never be reclaimed).
In JavaScript, objects and non-registered symbols are garbage
collectable, so they can be registered in a
\f[V]FinalizationRegistry\f[R] object as the target or the token.
.PP
If \f[V]target\f[R] is reclaimed, your cleanup callback may be called at
some point with the \f[I]held value\f[R] you provided for it
(\f[V]\[dq]some value\[dq]\f[R] in the above).
The held value can be any value you like: a primitive or an object, even
\f[V]undefined\f[R].
If the held value is an object, the registry keeps a \f[I]strong\f[R]
reference to it (so it can pass it to your cleanup callback later).
.PP
If you might want to unregister a registered target value later, you
pass a third value, which is the \f[I]unregistration token\f[R]
you\[cq]ll use later when calling the registry\[cq]s
\f[V]unregister\f[R] function to unregister the value.
The registry only keeps a weak reference to the unregister token.
.PP
It\[cq]s common to use the target value itself as the unregister token,
which is just fine:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
registry.register(target, \[dq]some value\[dq], target);
// \&...

// some time later, if you don\[aq]t care about \[ga]target\[ga] anymore, unregister it
registry.unregister(target);
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
It doesn\[cq]t have to be the same value, though; it can be a different
one:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
registry.register(target, \[dq]some value\[dq], token);
// \&...

// some time later
registry.unregister(token);
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Avoid where possible
.PP
Correct use of \f[V]FinalizationRegistry\f[R] takes careful thought, and
it\[cq]s best avoided if possible.
It\[cq]s also important to avoid relying on any specific behaviors not
guaranteed by the specification.
When, how, and whether garbage collection occurs is down to the
implementation of any given JavaScript engine.
Any behavior you observe in one engine may be different in another
engine, in another version of the same engine, or even in a slightly
different situation with the same version of the same engine.
Garbage collection is a hard problem that JavaScript engine implementers
are constantly refining and improving their solutions to.
.PP
Here are some specific points that the authors of the WeakRef proposal
that FinalizationRegistry is part of included in its explainer
document (https://github.com/tc39/proposal-weakrefs/blob/master/reference.md):
.RS
.PP
Garbage
collectors (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science))
are complicated.
If an application or library depends on GC cleaning up a
FinalizationRegistry or calling a finalizer [cleanup callback] in a
timely, predictable manner, it\[cq]s likely to be disappointed: the
cleanup may happen much later than expected, or not at all.
Sources of variability include:
.IP \[bu] 2
One object might be garbage-collected much sooner than another object,
even if they become unreachable at the same time, e.g., due to
generational collection.
.IP \[bu] 2
Garbage collection work can be split up over time using incremental and
concurrent techniques.
.IP \[bu] 2
Various runtime heuristics can be used to balance memory usage,
responsiveness.
.IP \[bu] 2
The JavaScript engine may hold references to things which look like they
are unreachable (e.g., in closures, or inline caches).
.IP \[bu] 2
Different JavaScript engines may do these things differently, or the
same engine may change its algorithms across versions.
.IP \[bu] 2
Complex factors may lead to objects being held alive for unexpected
amounts of time, such as use with certain APIs.
.RE
.SS Notes on cleanup callbacks
.IP \[bu] 2
Developers shouldn\[cq]t rely on cleanup callbacks for essential program
logic.
Cleanup callbacks may be useful for reducing memory usage across the
course of a program, but are unlikely to be useful otherwise.
.IP \[bu] 2
A conforming JavaScript implementation, even one that does garbage
collection, is not required to call cleanup callbacks.
When and whether it does so is entirely down to the implementation of
the JavaScript engine.
When a registered object is reclaimed, any cleanup callbacks for it may
be called then, or some time later, or not at all.
.IP \[bu] 2
It\[cq]s likely that major implementations will call cleanup callbacks
at some point during execution, but those calls may be substantially
after the related object was reclaimed.
.IP \[bu] 2
There are also situations where even implementations that normally call
cleanup callbacks are unlikely to call them:
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
When the JavaScript program shuts down entirely (for instance, closing a
tab in a browser).
.IP \[bu] 2
When the \f[V]FinalizationRegistry\f[R] instance itself is no longer
reachable by JavaScript code.
