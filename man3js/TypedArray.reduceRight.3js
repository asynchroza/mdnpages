.SH NAME
TypedArray.reduceRight - TypedArray.prototype.reduceRight()
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]reduceRight()\f[B]\f[R] method applies a function against
an accumulator and each value of the typed array (from right-to-left)
has to reduce it to a single value.
This method has the same algorithm as
\f[CR]Array.prototype.reduceRight()\f[R].
\f[I]TypedArray\f[R] is one of the typed array types here.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
reduceRight(callbackFn)
reduceRight(callbackFn, initialValue)
.EE
.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]callbackFn\f[R]
A function to execute for each element in the typed array.
Its return value becomes the value of the \f[CR]accumulator\f[R]
parameter on the next invocation of \f[CR]callbackFn\f[R].
For the last invocation, the return value becomes the return value of
\f[CR]reduceRight()\f[R].
The function is called with the following arguments:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]accumulator\f[R]
The value previously returned in the last invocation of the callback, or
\f[CR]initialValue\f[R], if supplied.
(See below.)
.TP
\f[B]currentValue\f[R]
The current element being processed in the typed array.
.TP
\f[B]index\f[R]
The index of the current element being processed in the typed array.
.TP
\f[B]array\f[R]
The typed array \f[CR]reduceRight()\f[R] was called upon.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]initialValue\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
Value to use as accumulator to the first call of the
\f[CR]callbackFn\f[R].
If no initial value is supplied, the last element in the array will be
used and skipped.
Calling \f[CR]reduceRight()\f[R] on an empty array without an initial
value creates a \f[CR]TypeError\f[R].
.SS Return value
The value that results from the reduction.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f[CR]reduceRight\f[R] method executes the \f[CR]callbackFn\f[R]
function once for each element present in the typed array, excluding
holes in the typed array, receiving four arguments: the initial value
(or value from the previous \f[CR]callbackFn\f[R] call), the value of
the current element, the current index, and the typed array over which
iteration is occurring.
.PP
The call to the \f[CR]reduceRight\f[R] callback would look something
like this:
.IP
.EX
typedarray.reduceRight((accumulator, currentValue, index, typedarray) => {
  // ...
});
.EE
.PP
The first time the function is called, the \f[CR]accumulator\f[R] and
\f[CR]currentValue\f[R] can be one of two values.
If an \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] was provided in the call to
\f[CR]reduceRight\f[R], then \f[CR]accumulator\f[R] will be equal to
\f[CR]initialValue\f[R] and \f[CR]currentValue\f[R] will be equal to the
last value in the typed array.
If no \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] was provided, then \f[CR]accumulator\f[R]
will be equal to the last value in the typed array and
\f[CR]currentValue\f[R] will be equal to the second-to-last value.
.PP
If the typed array is empty and no \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] was provided,
\f[CR]TypeError\f[R] would be thrown.
If the typed array has only one element (regardless of position) and no
\f[CR]initialValue\f[R] was provided, or if \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] is
provided but the typed array is empty, the solo value would be returned
without calling \f[CR]callbackFn\f[R].

const total = new Uint8Array([0, 1, 2, 3]).reduceRight((a, b) => a + b);
// total === 6
