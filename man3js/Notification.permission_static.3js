The following snippet could be used if you wanted to first check whether
notifications are supported, then check if permission has been granted
for the current origin to send notifications, then request permission if
required, before then sending a notification.
.IP
.EX
function notifyMe() {
  if (!(\[dq]Notification\[dq] in window)) {
    // Check if the browser supports notifications
    alert(\[dq]This browser does not support desktop notification\[dq]);
  } else if (Notification.permission === \[dq]granted\[dq]) {
    // Check whether notification permissions have already been granted;
    // if so, create a notification
    const notification = new Notification(\[dq]Hi there!\[dq]);
    // \&...
  } else if (Notification.permission !== \[dq]denied\[dq]) {
    // We need to ask the user for permission
    Notification.requestPermission().then((permission) => {
      // If the user accepts, let\[aq]s create a notification
      if (permission === \[dq]granted\[dq]) {
        const notification = new Notification(\[dq]Hi there!\[dq]);
        // \&...
      }
    });
  }

  // At last, if the user has denied notifications, and you
  // want to be respectful there is no need to bother them anymore.
