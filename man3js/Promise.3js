.SH NAME

Promise - Promise
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The \f[B]\f[VB]Promise\f[B]\f[R] object represents the eventual
completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting
value.
.PP
To learn about the way promises work and how you can use them, we advise
you to read Using promises first.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A \f[B]\f[VB]Promise\f[B]\f[R] is a proxy for a value not necessarily
known when the promise is created.
It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action\[cq]s
eventual success value or failure reason.
This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods:
instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous
method returns a \f[I]promise\f[R] to supply the value at some point in
the future.
.PP
A \f[V]Promise\f[R] is in one of these states:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]pending\f[R]: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]fulfilled\f[R]: meaning that the operation was completed
successfully.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]rejected\f[R]: meaning that the operation failed.
.PP
The \f[I]eventual state\f[R] of a pending promise can either be
\f[I]fulfilled\f[R] with a value or \f[I]rejected\f[R] with a reason
(error).
When either of these options occur, the associated handlers queued up by
a promise\[cq]s \f[V]then\f[R] method are called.
If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a
corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called, so there
is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and
its handlers being attached.
.PP
A promise is said to be \f[I]settled\f[R] if it is either fulfilled or
rejected, but not pending.
[IMAGE: Flowchart showing how the Promise state transitions between
pending, fulfilled, and rejected via then/catch handlers.
A pending promise can become either fulfilled or rejected.
If fulfilled, the \[lq]on fulfillment\[rq] handler, or first parameter
of the then() method, is executed and carries out further asynchronous
actions.
If rejected, the error handler, either passed as the second parameter of
the then() method or as the sole parameter of the catch() method, gets
executed.]
Flowchart showing how the Promise state transitions between pending,
fulfilled, and rejected via then/catch handlers.
A pending promise can become either fulfilled or rejected.
If fulfilled, the \[lq]on fulfillment\[rq] handler, or first parameter
of the then() method, is executed and carries out further asynchronous
actions.
If rejected, the error handler, either passed as the second parameter of
the then() method or as the sole parameter of the catch() method, gets
executed.
.PP
You will also hear the term \f[I]resolved\f[R] used with promises \[em]
this means that the promise is settled or \[lq]locked-in\[rq] to match
the eventual state of another promise, and further resolving or
rejecting it has no effect.
The States and
fates (https://github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping/blob/master/docs/states-and-fates.md)
document from the original Promise proposal contains more details about
promise terminology.
Colloquially, \[lq]resolved\[rq] promises are often equivalent to
\[lq]fulfilled\[rq] promises, but as illustrated in \[lq]States and
fates\[rq], resolved promises can be pending or rejected as well.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
new Promise((resolveOuter) => {
  resolveOuter(
    new Promise((resolveInner) => {
      setTimeout(resolveInner, 1000);
    }),
  );
});
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This promise is already \f[I]resolved\f[R] at the time when it\[cq]s
created (because the \f[V]resolveOuter\f[R] is called synchronously),
but it is resolved with another promise, and therefore won\[cq]t be
\f[I]fulfilled\f[R] until 1 second later, when the inner promise
fulfills.
In practice, the \[lq]resolution\[rq] is often done behind the scenes
and not observable, and only its fulfillment or rejection are.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] Several other languages have mechanisms for lazy
evaluation and deferring a computation, which they also call
\[lq]promises\[rq], e.g.\ Scheme.
Promises in JavaScript represent processes that are already happening,
which can be chained with callback functions.
If you are looking to lazily evaluate an expression, consider using a
function with no arguments e.g.\ \f[V]f = () => expression\f[R] to
create the lazily-evaluated expression, and \f[V]f()\f[R] to evaluate
the expression immediately.
.RE
.SS Chained Promises
.PP
The methods \f[V]Promise.prototype.then()\f[R],
\f[V]Promise.prototype.catch()\f[R], and
\f[V]Promise.prototype.finally()\f[R] are used to associate further
action with a promise that becomes settled.
As these methods return promises, they can be chained.
.PP
The \f[V].then()\f[R] method takes up to two arguments; the first
argument is a callback function for the fulfilled case of the promise,
and the second argument is a callback function for the rejected case.
Each \f[V].then()\f[R] returns a newly generated promise object, which
can optionally be used for chaining; for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve(\[dq]foo\[dq]);
  }, 300);
});

myPromise
  .then(handleFulfilledA, handleRejectedA)
  .then(handleFulfilledB, handleRejectedB)
  .then(handleFulfilledC, handleRejectedC);
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Processing continues to the next link of the chain even when a
\f[V].then()\f[R] lacks a callback function that returns a Promise
object.
Therefore, a chain can safely omit every \f[I]rejection\f[R] callback
function until the final \f[V].catch()\f[R].
.PP
Handling a rejected promise in each \f[V].then()\f[R] has consequences
further down the promise chain.
Sometimes there is no choice, because an error must be handled
immediately.
In such cases we must throw an error of some type to maintain error
state down the chain.
On the other hand, in the absence of an immediate need, it is simpler to
leave out error handling until a final \f[V].catch()\f[R] statement.
A \f[V].catch()\f[R] is really just a \f[V].then()\f[R] without a slot
for a callback function for the case when the promise is fulfilled.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
myPromise
  .then(handleFulfilledA)
  .then(handleFulfilledB)
  .then(handleFulfilledC)
  .catch(handleRejectedAny);
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Using arrow functions for the callback functions, implementation of the
promise chain might look something like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
myPromise
  .then((value) => \[ga]${value} and bar\[ga])
  .then((value) => \[ga]${value} and bar again\[ga])
  .then((value) => \[ga]${value} and again\[ga])
  .then((value) => \[ga]${value} and again\[ga])
  .then((value) => {
    console.log(value);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
  });
\f[R]
.fi
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] For faster execution, all synchronous actions should
preferably be done within one handler, otherwise it would take several
ticks to execute all handlers in sequence.
.RE
.PP
The termination condition of a promise determines the \[lq]settled\[rq]
state of the next promise in the chain.
A \[lq]fulfilled\[rq] state indicates a successful completion of the
promise, while a \[lq]rejected\[rq] state indicates a lack of success.
The return value of each fulfilled promise in the chain is passed along
to the next \f[V].then()\f[R], while the reason for rejection is passed
along to the next rejection-handler function in the chain.
.PP
The promises of a chain are nested in one another, but get popped like
the top of a stack.
The first promise in the chain is most deeply nested and is the first to
pop.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
(promise D, (promise C, (promise B, (promise A) ) ) )
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When a \f[V]nextValue\f[R] is a promise, the effect is a dynamic
replacement.
The \f[V]return\f[R] causes a promise to be popped, but the
\f[V]nextValue\f[R] promise is pushed into its place.
For the nesting shown above, suppose the \f[V].then()\f[R] associated
with \[lq]promise B\[rq] returns a \f[V]nextValue\f[R] of \[lq]promise
X\[rq].
The resulting nesting would look like this:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
(promise D, (promise C, (promise X) ) )
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
A promise can participate in more than one nesting.
For the following code, the transition of \f[V]promiseA\f[R] into a
\[lq]settled\[rq] state will cause both instances of \f[V].then()\f[R]
to be invoked.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
const promiseA = new Promise(myExecutorFunc);
const promiseB = promiseA.then(handleFulfilled1, handleRejected1);
const promiseC = promiseA.then(handleFulfilled2, handleRejected2);
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
An action can be assigned to an already \[lq]settled\[rq] promise.
In that case, the action (if appropriate) will be performed at the first
asynchronous opportunity.
Note that promises are guaranteed to be asynchronous.
Therefore, an action for an already \[lq]settled\[rq] promise will occur
only after the stack has cleared and a clock-tick has passed.
The effect is much like that of \f[V]setTimeout(action,10)\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
const promiseA = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  resolve(777);
});
// At this point, \[dq]promiseA\[dq] is already settled.
promiseA.then((val) => console.log(\[dq]asynchronous logging has val:\[dq], val));
console.log(\[dq]immediate logging\[dq]);

// produces output in this order:
// immediate logging
// asynchronous logging has val: 777
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Thenables
.PP
The JavaScript ecosystem had made multiple Promise implementations long
before it became part of the language.
Despite being represented differently internally, at the minimum, all
Promise-like objects implement the \f[I]Thenable\f[R] interface.
A thenable implements the \f[V].then()\f[R] method, which is called with
two callbacks: one for when the promise is fulfilled, one for when
it\[cq]s rejected.
Promises are thenables as well.
.PP
To interoperate with the existing Promise implementations, the language
allows using thenables in place of promises.
For example, \f[V]Promise.resolve\f[R] will not only resolve promises,
but also trace thenables.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
const aThenable = {
  then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
    onFulfilled({
      // The thenable is fulfilled with another thenable
      then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
        onFulfilled(42);
      },
    });
  },
};

Promise.resolve(aThenable); // A promise fulfilled with 42
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Promise concurrency
.PP
The \f[V]Promise\f[R] class offers four static methods to facilitate
async task
concurrency (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_computing):
.TP
\f[B]Promise.all()\f[R]
Fulfills when \f[B]all\f[R] of the promises fulfill; rejects when
\f[B]any\f[R] of the promises rejects.
.TP
\f[B]Promise.allSettled()\f[R]
Fulfills when \f[B]all\f[R] promises settle.
.TP
\f[B]Promise.any()\f[R]
Fulfills when \f[B]any\f[R] of the promises fulfills; rejects when
\f[B]all\f[R] of the promises reject.
.TP
\f[B]Promise.race()\f[R]
Settles when \f[B]any\f[R] of the promises settles.
In other words, fulfills when any of the promises fulfills; rejects when
any of the promises rejects.
.PP
All these methods take an iterable of promises (thenables, to be exact)
and return a new promise.
They all support subclassing, which means they can be called on
subclasses of \f[V]Promise\f[R], and the result will be a promise of the
subclass type.
To do so, the subclass\[cq]s constructor must implement the same
signature as the \f[V]Promise()\f[R] constructor \[em] accepting a
single \f[V]executor\f[R] function that can be called with the
\f[V]resolve\f[R] and \f[V]reject\f[R] callbacks as parameters.
The subclass must also have a \f[V]resolve\f[R] static method that can
be called like \f[V]Promise.resolve()\f[R] to resolve values to
promises.
.PP
Note that JavaScript is single-threaded by nature, so at a given
instant, only one task will be executing, although control can shift
between different promises, making execution of the promises appear
concurrent.
Parallel execution (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing) in
JavaScript can only be achieved through worker threads.
.SH CONSTRUCTOR
.TP
\f[B]Promise()\f[R]
Creates a new \f[V]Promise\f[R] object.
The constructor is primarily used to wrap functions that do not already
support promises.
.SH STATIC PROPERTIES
.TP
\f[B]Promise[\[at]\[at]species]\f[R]
Returns the constructor used to construct return values from promise
methods.
.SH STATIC METHODS
.TP
\f[B]Promise.all()\f[R]
Wait for all promises to be fulfilled, or for any to be rejected.
.RS
.PP
If the returned promise fulfills, it is fulfilled with an aggregating
array of the values from the fulfilled promises, in the same order as
defined in the iterable of multiple promises.
.PP
If it rejects, it is rejected with the reason from the first promise in
the iterable that was rejected.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]Promise.allSettled()\f[R]
Wait until all promises have settled (each may fulfill or reject).
.RS
.PP
Returns a Promise that fulfills after all of the given promises is
either fulfilled or rejected, with an array of objects that each
describe the outcome of each promise.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]Promise.any()\f[R]
Takes an iterable of Promise objects and, as soon as one of the promises
in the iterable fulfills, returns a single promise that fulfills with
the value from that promise.
.TP
\f[B]Promise.race()\f[R]
Wait until any of the promises is fulfilled or rejected.
.RS
.PP
If the returned promise fulfills, it is fulfilled with the value of the
first promise in the iterable that fulfilled.
.PP
If it rejects, it is rejected with the reason from the first promise
that was rejected.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]Promise.reject()\f[R]
Returns a new \f[V]Promise\f[R] object that is rejected with the given
reason.
.TP
\f[B]Promise.resolve()\f[R]
Returns a new \f[V]Promise\f[R] object that is resolved with the given
value.
If the value is a thenable (i.e.\ has a \f[V]then\f[R] method), the
returned promise will \[lq]follow\[rq] that thenable, adopting its
eventual state; otherwise, the returned promise will be fulfilled with
the value.
.RS
.PP
Generally, if you don\[cq]t know if a value is a promise or not,
\f[V]Promise.resolve(value)\f[R] it instead and work with the return
value as a promise.
.RE
.SH INSTANCE PROPERTIES
.PP
These properties are defined on \f[V]Promise.prototype\f[R] and shared
by all \f[V]Promise\f[R] instances.
.TP
\f[B]Promise.prototype.constructor\f[R]
The constructor function that created the instance object.
For \f[V]Promise\f[R] instances, the initial value is the
\f[V]Promise\f[R] constructor.
.TP
\f[B]Promise.prototype[\[at]\[at]toStringTag]\f[R]
The initial value of the \f[V]\[at]\[at]toStringTag\f[R] property is the
string \f[V]\[dq]Promise\[dq]\f[R].
This property is used in \f[V]Object.prototype.toString()\f[R].
.SH INSTANCE METHODS
.TP
\f[B]Promise.prototype.catch()\f[R]
Appends a rejection handler callback to the promise, and returns a new
promise resolving to the return value of the callback if it is called,
or to its original fulfillment value if the promise is instead
fulfilled.
.TP
\f[B]Promise.prototype.finally()\f[R]
Appends a handler to the promise, and returns a new promise that is
resolved when the original promise is resolved.
The handler is called when the promise is settled, whether fulfilled or
rejected.
.TP
\f[B]Promise.prototype.then()\f[R]
Appends fulfillment and rejection handlers to the promise, and returns a
new promise resolving to the return value of the called handler, or to
its original settled value if the promise was not handled (i.e.\ if the
relevant handler \f[V]onFulfilled\f[R] or \f[V]onRejected\f[R] is not a
function).

.SS Example with diverse situations
.PP
This example shows diverse techniques for using Promise capabilities and
diverse situations that can occur.
To understand this, start by scrolling to the bottom of the code block,
and examine the promise chain.
Upon provision of an initial promise, a chain of promises can follow.
The chain is composed of \f[V].then()\f[R] calls, and typically (but not
necessarily) has a single \f[V].catch()\f[R] at the end, optionally
followed by \f[V].finally()\f[R].
In this example, the promise chain is initiated by a custom-written
\f[V]new Promise()\f[R] construct; but in actual practice, promise
chains more typically start with an API function (written by someone
else) that returns a promise.
.PP
The example function \f[V]tetheredGetNumber()\f[R] shows that a promise
generator will utilize \f[V]reject()\f[R] while setting up an
asynchronous call, or within the call-back, or both.
The function \f[V]promiseGetWord()\f[R] illustrates how an API function
might generate and return a promise in a self-contained manner.
.PP
Note that the function \f[V]troubleWithGetNumber()\f[R] ends with a
\f[V]throw\f[R].
That is forced because a promise chain goes through all the
\f[V].then()\f[R] promises, even after an error, and without the
\f[V]throw\f[R], the error would seem \[lq]fixed\[rq].
This is a hassle, and for this reason, it is common to omit
\f[V]onRejected\f[R] throughout the chain of \f[V].then()\f[R] promises,
and just have a single \f[V]onRejected\f[R] in the final
\f[V]catch()\f[R].
.PP
This code can be run under NodeJS.
Comprehension is enhanced by seeing the errors actually occur.
To force more errors, change the \f[V]threshold\f[R] values.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
// To experiment with error handling, \[dq]threshold\[dq] values cause errors randomly
const THRESHOLD_A = 8; // can use zero 0 to guarantee error

function tetheredGetNumber(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const randomInt = Date.now();
    const value = randomInt % 10;
    if (value < THRESHOLD_A) {
      resolve(value);
    } else {
      reject(\[ga]Too large: ${value}\[ga]);
    }
  }, 500);
}

function determineParity(value) {
  const isOdd = value % 2 === 1;
  return { value, isOdd };
}

function troubleWithGetNumber(reason) {
  const err = new Error(\[dq]Trouble getting number\[dq], { cause: reason });
  console.error(err);
  throw err;
}

function promiseGetWord(parityInfo) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const { value, isOdd } = parityInfo;
    if (value >= THRESHOLD_A - 1) {
      reject(\[ga]Still too large: ${value}\[ga]);
    } else {
      parityInfo.wordEvenOdd = isOdd ? \[dq]odd\[dq] : \[dq]even\[dq];
      resolve(parityInfo);
    }
  });
}

new Promise(tetheredGetNumber)
  .then(determineParity, troubleWithGetNumber)
  .then(promiseGetWord)
  .then((info) => {
    console.log(\[ga]Got: ${info.value}, ${info.wordEvenOdd}\[ga]);
    return info;
  })
  .catch((reason) => {

      console.error(\[dq]Had previously handled error\[dq]);

      console.error(\[ga]Trouble with promiseGetWord(): ${reason}\[ga]);
    }

.SS Advanced Example
.PP
This small example shows the mechanism of a \f[V]Promise\f[R].
The \f[V]testPromise()\f[R] method is called each time the
\f[V]<button>\f[R] is clicked.
It creates a promise that will be fulfilled, using
\f[V]setTimeout()\f[R], to the promise count (number starting from 1)
every 1-3 seconds, at random.
The \f[V]Promise()\f[R] constructor is used to create the promise.
.PP
The fulfillment of the promise is logged, via a fulfill callback set
using \f[V]p1.then()\f[R].
A few logs show how the synchronous part of the method is decoupled from
the asynchronous completion of the promise.
.PP
By clicking the button several times in a short amount of time,
you\[cq]ll even see the different promises being fulfilled one after
another.

Another simple example using \f[V]Promise\f[R] and
\f[V]XMLHttpRequest\f[R] to load an image is available at the MDN GitHub
js-examples (https://github.com/mdn/js-examples/tree/master/promises-test)
repository.
You can also see it in
action (https://mdn.github.io/js-examples/promises-test/).
Each step is commented on and allows you to follow the Promise and XHR
architecture closely.
.SS Incumbent settings object tracking
.PP
A settings object is an
environment (https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#environment-settings-object)
that provides additional information when JavaScript code is running.
This includes the realm and module map, as well as HTML specific
information such as the origin.
The incumbent settings object is tracked in order to ensure that the
browser knows which one to use for a given piece of user code.
.PP
To better picture this, we can take a closer look at how the realm might
be an issue.
A \f[B]realm\f[R] can be roughly thought of as the global object.
What is unique about realms is that they hold all of the necessary
information to run JavaScript code.
This includes objects like \f[V]Array\f[R] and \f[V]Error\f[R].
Each settings object has its own \[lq]copy\[rq] of these and they are
not shared.
That can cause some unexpected behavior in relation to promises.
In order to get around this, we track something called the
\f[B]incumbent settings object\f[R].
This represents information specific to the context of the user code
responsible for a certain function call.
.PP
To illustrate this a bit further we can take a look at how an
\f[V]<iframe>\f[R] embedded in a document communicates with its host.
Since all web APIs are aware of the incumbent settings object, the
following will work in all browsers:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<!DOCTYPE html> <iframe></iframe>
<!-- we have a realm here -->
<script>
  // we have a realm here as well
  const bound = frames[0].postMessage.bind(frames[0], \[dq]some data\[dq], \[dq]*\[dq]);
  // bound is a built-in function \[em] there is no user
  // code on the stack, so which realm do we use?
  setTimeout(bound);
  // this still works, because we use the youngest
  // realm (the incumbent) on the stack
</script>
\f[R]

The same concept applies to promises.
If we modify the above example a little bit, we get this:

  // bound is a built in function \[em] there is no user

If we change this so that the \f[V]<iframe>\f[R] in the document is
listening to post messages, we can observe the effect of the incumbent
settings object:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<!-- y.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<iframe src=\[dq]x.html\[dq]></iframe>
<script>
  const bound = frames[0].postMessage.bind(frames[0], \[dq]some data\[dq], \[dq]*\[dq]);
  Promise.resolve(undefined).then(bound);
</script>
\f[R]
.fi
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
<!-- x.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<script>
  window.addEventListener(
    \[dq]message\[dq],
    (event) => {
      document.querySelector(\[dq]#text\[dq]).textContent = \[dq]hello\[dq];
      // this code will only run in browsers that track the incumbent settings object
      console.log(event);
    },
    false,
  );
</script>
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In the above example, the inner text of the \f[V]<iframe>\f[R] will be
updated only if the incumbent settings object is tracked.
This is because without tracking the incumbent, we may end up using the
wrong environment to send the message.

\f[B]Note:\f[R] Currently, incumbent realm tracking is fully implemented
in Firefox, and has partial implementations in Chrome and Safari.
