.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]sinkId\f[R]
The \f[CR]MediaDeviceInfo.deviceId\f[R] of the audio output device.
.SS Return value
A \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves to \f[CR]undefined\f[R].
.SS Exceptions
.TP
\f[B]NotAllowedError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
Returned if a \f[CR]speaker\-selection\f[R] Permissions Policy is used
to block use of audio outputs.
.TP
\f[B]NotFoundError\f[R] \f[B]DOMException\f[R]
Returned if the \f[CR]deviceId\f[R] does not match any audio output
device.

.SH SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
Access to the API is subject to the following constraints:
.IP \[bu] 2
The method must be called in a secure context.
.IP \[bu] 2
Access may be gated by the \f[CR]speaker\-selection\f[R] HTTP Permission
Policy.
.IP \[bu] 2
User permission is required to access a non\-default device.
The user grants permission by selecting the device associated with the
ID in the prompt displayed by
\f[CR]MediaDevices.selectAudioOutput()\f[R].
.SH EXAMPLES
This example shows how to select an audio output device from the array
returned by \f[CR]MediaDevices.enumerateDevices()\f[R], and set it as
the sink for audio.
Note that the result of \f[CR]enumerateDevices()\f[R] only includes
devices for which user permission is not required or has already been
been granted.
.IP
.EX
const devices = await navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices();
const audioDevice = devices.find((device) => device.kind === \[dq]audiooutput\[dq]);
const audio = document.createElement(\[dq]audio\[dq]);
await audio.setSinkId(audioDevice.deviceId);
console.log(\[ga]Audio is being output on ${audio.sinkId}\[ga]);
