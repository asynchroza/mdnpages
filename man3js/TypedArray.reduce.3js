.SH NAME
TypedArray.reduce - TypedArray.prototype.reduce()
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]reduce()\f[B]\f[R] method applies a function against an
accumulator and each value of the typed array (from left-to-right) has
to reduce it to a single value.
This method has the same algorithm as
\f[CR]Array.prototype.reduce()\f[R].
\f[I]TypedArray\f[R] is one of the typed array types here.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
reduce(callbackFn)
reduce(callbackFn, initialValue)
.EE
.SS Parameters
.TP
\f[B]callbackFn\f[R]
A function to execute for each element in the typed array.
Its return value becomes the value of the \f[CR]accumulator\f[R]
parameter on the next invocation of \f[CR]callbackFn\f[R].
For the last invocation, the return value becomes the return value of
\f[CR]reduce()\f[R].
The function is called with the following arguments:
.RS
.TP
\f[B]accumulator\f[R]
The value resulting from the previous call to \f[CR]callbackFn\f[R].
On first call, \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] if specified, otherwise the value
of \f[CR]array[0]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]currentValue\f[R]
The value of the current element.
On first call, the value of \f[CR]array[0]\f[R] if an
\f[CR]initialValue\f[R] was specified, otherwise the value of
\f[CR]array[1]\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]currentIndex\f[R]
The index position of \f[CR]currentValue\f[R] in the typed array.
On first call, \f[CR]0\f[R] if \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] was specified,
otherwise \f[CR]1\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]array\f[R]
The typed array \f[CR]reduce()\f[R] was called upon.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]initialValue\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
A value to which \f[CR]accumulator\f[R] is initialized the first time
the callback is called.
If \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] is specified, \f[CR]callbackFn\f[R] starts
executing with the first value in the typed array as
\f[CR]currentValue\f[R].
If \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] is \f[I]not\f[R] specified,
\f[CR]accumulator\f[R] is initialized to the first value in the typed
array, and \f[CR]callbackFn\f[R] starts executing with the second value
in the typed array as \f[CR]currentValue\f[R].
In this case, if the typed array is empty (so that there\[cq]s no first
value to return as \f[CR]accumulator\f[R]), an error is thrown.
.SS Return value
The value that results from the reduction.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \f[CR]reduce\f[R] method executes the \f[CR]callbackFn\f[R] function
once for each element present in the typed array, excluding holes in the
typed array, receiving four arguments: the initial value (or value from
the previous \f[CR]callbackFn\f[R] call), the value of the current
element, the current index, and the typed array over which iteration is
occurring.
.PP
The first time the callback is called, \f[CR]accumulator\f[R] and
\f[CR]currentValue\f[R] can be one of two values.
If \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] is provided in the call to \f[CR]reduce\f[R],
then \f[CR]accumulator\f[R] will be equal to \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] and
\f[CR]currentValue\f[R] will be equal to the first value in the typed
array.
If no \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] was provided, then \f[CR]accumulator\f[R]
will be equal to the first value in the typed array and
\f[CR]currentValue\f[R] will be equal to the second.
.PP
If the typed array is empty and no \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] was provided,
\f[CR]TypeError\f[R] would be thrown.
If the typed array has only one element (regardless of position) and no
\f[CR]initialValue\f[R] was provided, or if \f[CR]initialValue\f[R] is
provided but the typed array is empty, the solo value would be returned
without calling \f[CR]callbackFn\f[R].
