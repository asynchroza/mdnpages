.SH NAME
CacheStorage.keys \- CacheStorage: keys() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]keys()\f[B]\f[R] method of the \f[CR]CacheStorage\f[R]
interface returns a \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that will resolve with an array
containing strings corresponding to all of the named \f[CR]Cache\f[R]
objects tracked by the \f[CR]CacheStorage\f[R] object in the order they
were created.
Use this method to iterate over a list of all \f[CR]Cache\f[R] objects.
.PP
You can access \f[CR]CacheStorage\f[R] through the global
\f[CR]caches\f[R] property.
.SH SYNTAX
.IP
.EX
keys()
.EE
.SS Parameters
None.
.SS Return value
a \f[CR]Promise\f[R] that resolves with an array of the \f[CR]Cache\f[R]
names inside the \f[CR]CacheStorage\f[R] object.
.SH EXAMPLES
In this code snippet we wait for an \f[CR]activate\f[R] event, and then
run a \f[CR]waitUntil()\f[R] block that clears up any old, unused caches
before a new service worker is activated.
Here we have an allowlist containing the names of the caches we want to
keep (\f[CR]cacheAllowlist\f[R]).
We return the keys of the caches in the \f[CR]CacheStorage\f[R] object
using \f[CR]keys()\f[R], then check each key to see if it is in the
allowlist.
If not, we delete it using \f[CR]CacheStorage.delete()\f[R].

        keyList.map((key) => {

            return caches.delete(key);
