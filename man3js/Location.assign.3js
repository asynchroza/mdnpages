.SH NAME
Location.assign \- Location: assign() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]Location.assign()\f[B]\f[R] method causes the window to
load and display the document at the URL specified.
After the navigation occurs, the user can navigate back to the page that
called \f[CR]Location.assign()\f[R] by pressing the \[lq]back\[rq]
button.
.PP
If the assignment can\[cq]t happen because of a security violation, a
\f[CR]DOMException\f[R] of the \f[CR]SECURITY_ERROR\f[R] type is thrown.
This happens if the origin of the script calling the method is different
from the origin of the page originally described by the
\f[CR]Location\f[R] object, mostly when the script is hosted on a
different domain.
.PP
If the provided URL is not valid, a \f[CR]DOMException\f[R] of the
\f[CR]SYNTAX_ERROR\f[R] type is thrown.
