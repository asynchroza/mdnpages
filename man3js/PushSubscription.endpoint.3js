.SH NAME
PushSubscription.endpoint \- PushSubscription: endpoint property
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]endpoint\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]PushSubscription\f[R] interface returns a string containing the
endpoint associated with the push subscription.
.PP
The endpoint takes the form of a custom URL pointing to a push server,
which can be used to send a push message to the particular service
worker instance that subscribed to the push service.
For this reason, it is a good idea to keep your endpoint a secret, so
others do not hijack it and abuse the push functionality.
.SH VALUE
A string.
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.EX
navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((reg) => {
  reg.pushManager.subscribe({ userVisibleOnly: true }).then((subscription) => {
    console.log(subscription.endpoint);

    // At this point you would most likely send the subscription
    // endpoint to your server, save it, then use it to send a
    // push message at a later date
  });
});
