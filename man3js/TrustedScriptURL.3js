.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]TrustedScriptURL\f[B]\f[R] interface of the
\f[CR]Trusted Types API\f[R] represents a string that a developer can
insert into an injection sink that will parse it as a URL of an external
script.
These objects are created via
\f[CR]TrustedTypePolicy.createScriptURL()\f[R] and therefore have no
constructor.

The value of a \f[B]TrustedScriptURL\f[R] object is set when the object
is created and cannot be changed by JavaScript as there is no setter
exposed.
