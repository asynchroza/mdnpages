Date.Date - Date() constructor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
The \f[B]\f[VB]Date()\f[B]\f[R] constructor creates \f[V]Date\f[R]
objects.
When called as a function, it returns a string representing the current
time.

See Return value.
.RE
.SS Parameters
.PP
There are five basic forms for the \f[V]Date()\f[R] constructor:
.SS No parameters
.PP
When no parameters are provided, the newly-created \f[V]Date\f[R] object
represents the current date and time as of the time of instantiation.
The returned date\[cq]s timestamp is the same as the number returned by
\f[V]Date.now()\f[R].
.SS Time value or timestamp number
.TP
\f[B]value\f[R]
An integer value representing the timestamp (the number of milliseconds
since midnight at the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC \[em] a.k.a.
the epoch).
.SS Date string
.TP
\f[B]dateString\f[R]
A string value representing a date, parsed and interpreted using the
same algorithm implemented by \f[V]Date.parse()\f[R].
See date time string format for caveats on using different formats.
.SS Date object
.TP
\f[B]dateObject\f[R]
An existing \f[V]Date\f[R] object.
This effectively makes a copy of the existing \f[V]Date\f[R] object with
the same date and time.
This is equivalent to \f[V]new Date(dateObject.valueOf())\f[R], except
the \f[V]valueOf()\f[R] method is not called.
.PP
When one parameter is passed to the \f[V]Date()\f[R] constructor,
\f[V]Date\f[R] instances are specially treated.
All other values are converted to primitives.
If the result is a string, it will be parsed as a date string.
Otherwise, the resulting primitive is further coerced to a number and
treated as a timestamp.
.SS Individual date and time component values
.PP
Given at least a year and month, this form of \f[V]Date()\f[R] returns a
\f[V]Date\f[R] object whose component values (year, month, day, hour,
minute, second, and millisecond) all come from the following parameters.
Any missing fields are given the lowest possible value (\f[V]1\f[R] for
\f[V]day\f[R] and \f[V]0\f[R] for every other component).
The parameter values are all evaluated against the local time zone,
rather than UTC.
\f[V]Date.UTC()\f[R] accepts similar parameters but interprets the
components as UTC and returns a timestamp.
.PP
If any parameter overflows its defined bounds, it \[lq]carries
over\[rq].
For example, if a \f[V]monthIndex\f[R] greater than \f[V]11\f[R] is
passed in, those months will cause the year to increment; if a
\f[V]minutes\f[R] greater than \f[V]59\f[R] is passed in,
\f[V]hours\f[R] will increment accordingly, etc.
Therefore, \f[V]new Date(1990, 12, 1)\f[R] will return January 1st,
1991; \f[V]new Date(2020, 5, 19, 25, 65)\f[R] will return 2:05 A.M.
June 20th, 2020.
.PP
Similarly, if any parameter underflows, it \[lq]borrows\[rq] from the
higher positions.
For example, \f[V]new Date(2020, 5, 0)\f[R] will return May 31st, 2020.
.TP
\f[B]year\f[R]
Integer value representing the year.
Values from \f[V]0\f[R] to \f[V]99\f[R] map to the years \f[V]1900\f[R]
to \f[V]1999\f[R].
All other values are the actual year.
See the example.
.TP
\f[B]monthIndex\f[R]
Integer value representing the month, beginning with \f[V]0\f[R] for
January to \f[V]11\f[R] for December.
.TP
\f[B]day\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
Integer value representing the day of the month.
Defaults to \f[V]1\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]hours\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
Integer value between \f[V]0\f[R] and \f[V]23\f[R] representing the hour
of the day.
Defaults to \f[V]0\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]minutes\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
Integer value representing the minute segment of a time.
Defaults to \f[V]0\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]seconds\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
Integer value representing the second segment of a time.
Defaults to \f[V]0\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]milliseconds\f[R] \f[I](optional)\f[R]
Integer value representing the millisecond segment of a time.
Defaults to \f[V]0\f[R].
.SS Return value
.PP
Calling \f[V]new Date()\f[R] (the \f[V]Date()\f[R] constructor) returns
a \f[V]Date\f[R] object.
If called with an invalid date string, or if the date to be constructed
will have a timestamp less than \f[V]-8,640,000,000,000,000\f[R] or
greater than \f[V]8,640,000,000,000,000\f[R] milliseconds, it returns an
invalid date (a \f[V]Date\f[R] object whose \f[V]toString()\f[R] method
returns \f[V]\[dq]Invalid Date\[dq]\f[R] and \f[V]valueOf()\f[R] method
returns \f[V]NaN\f[R]).
.PP
Calling the \f[V]Date()\f[R] function (without the \f[V]new\f[R]
keyword) returns a string representation of the current date and time,
exactly as \f[V]new Date().toString()\f[R] does.
Any arguments given in a \f[V]Date()\f[R] function call (without the
\f[V]new\f[R] keyword) are ignored; regardless of whether it\[cq]s
called with an invalid date string \[em] or even called with any
arbitrary object or other primitive as an argument \[em] it always
returns a string representation of the current date and time.
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Several ways to create a Date object
.PP
The following examples show several ways to create JavaScript dates:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
const today = new Date();
const birthday = new Date(\[dq]December 17, 1995 03:24:00\[dq]); // DISCOURAGED: may not work in all runtimes
const birthday = new Date(\[dq]1995-12-17T03:24:00\[dq]); // This is standardized and will work reliably
const birthday = new Date(1995, 11, 17); // the month is 0-indexed
const birthday = new Date(1995, 11, 17, 3, 24, 0);
const birthday = new Date(628021800000); // passing epoch timestamp
\f[R]
.fi
.SS Passing a non-Date, non-string, non-number value
.PP
If the \f[V]Date()\f[R] constructor is called with one parameter which
is not a \f[V]Date\f[R] instance, it will be coerced to a primitive and
then checked whether it\[cq]s a string.
For example, \f[V]new Date(undefined)\f[R] is different from
\f[V]new Date()\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
console.log(new Date(undefined)); // Invalid Date
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This is because \f[V]undefined\f[R] is already a primitive but not a
string, so it will be coerced to a number, which is \f[V]NaN\f[R] and
therefore not a valid timestamp.
On the other hand, \f[V]null\f[R] will be coerced to \f[V]0\f[R].
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
console.log(new Date(null)); // 1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Arrays would be coerced to a string via
\f[V]Array.prototype.toString()\f[R], which joins the elements with
commas.
However, the resulting string for any array with more than one element
is not a valid ISO 8601 date string, so its parsing behavior would be
implementation-defined.
\f[B]Do not pass arrays to the \f[VB]Date()\f[B] constructor.\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
console.log(new Date([\[dq]2020-06-19\[dq], \[dq]17:13\[dq]]));
// 2020-06-19T17:13:00.000Z in Chrome, since it recognizes \[dq]2020-06-19,17:13\[dq]
// \[dq]Invalid Date\[dq] in Firefox
