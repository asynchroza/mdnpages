FileReader.readyState \- FileReader: readyState property
.SH SYNOPSIS
This feature is available in Web Workers.
.PP
The \f[B]\f[CB]readyState\f[B]\f[R] read\-only property of the
\f[CR]FileReader\f[R] interface provides the current state of the
reading operation a \f[CR]FileReader\f[R] is in.
A \f[CR]FileReader\f[R] exists in one of the following states:

.TP
\f[B]EMPTY\f[R]
The \f[CR]FileReader\f[R] has been created, but no readAs method was
called yet.
.TP
\f[B]LOADING\f[R]
A readAs method was invoked.
A \f[CR]File\f[R] or \f[CR]Blob\f[R] is being read, and no error has
occurred yet.
.TP
\f[B]DONE\f[R]
The read operation is complete.
This could mean that: the entire \f[CR]File\f[R] or \f[CR]Blob\f[R] has
been read into memory, a file read error occurred, or \f[CR]abort()\f[R]
was called and the read was cancelled.
.SH EXAMPLES

.EX
const reader = new FileReader();
console.log(\[dq]EMPTY\[dq], reader.readyState); // readyState will be 0

reader.readAsText(blob);
console.log(\[dq]LOADING\[dq], reader.readyState); // readyState will be 1

reader.onloadend = () => {
  console.log(\[dq]DONE\[dq], reader.readyState); // readyState will be 2
};

.SH VALUE
A number which is one of the three possible state constants define for
the \f[CR]FileReader\f[R] API.
