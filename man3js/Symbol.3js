.SH Synopsis
.PP
\f[B]\f[VB]Symbol\f[B]\f[R] is a built-in object whose constructor
returns a \f[V]symbol\f[R] primitive \[em] also called a \f[B]Symbol
value\f[R] or just a \f[B]Symbol\f[R] \[em] that\[cq]s guaranteed to be
unique.
Symbols are often used to add unique property keys to an object that
won\[cq]t collide with keys any other code might add to the object, and
which are hidden from any mechanisms other code will typically use to
access the object.
That enables a form of weak encapsulation, or a weak form of information
hiding (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_hiding).
.PP
Every \f[V]Symbol()\f[R] call is guaranteed to return a unique Symbol.
Every \f[V]Symbol.for(\[dq]key\[dq])\f[R] call will always return the
same Symbol for a given value of \f[V]\[dq]key\[dq]\f[R].
When \f[V]Symbol.for(\[dq]key\[dq])\f[R] is called, if a Symbol with the
given key can be found in the global Symbol registry, that Symbol is
returned.
Otherwise, a new Symbol is created, added to the global Symbol registry
under the given key, and returned.
.SH Description
.PP
To create a new primitive Symbol, you write \f[V]Symbol()\f[R] with an
optional string as its description:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
const sym1 = Symbol();
const sym2 = Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]);
const sym3 = Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]);
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The above code creates three new Symbols.
Note that \f[V]Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq])\f[R] does not coerce the string
\f[V]\[dq]foo\[dq]\f[R] into a Symbol.
It creates a new Symbol each time:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]) === Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]); // false
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The following syntax with the \f[V]new\f[R] operator will throw a
\f[V]TypeError\f[R]:
.PP
\f[B]Bad\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
const sym = new Symbol(); // TypeError
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This prevents authors from creating an explicit \f[V]Symbol\f[R] wrapper
object instead of a new Symbol value and might be surprising as creating
explicit wrapper objects around primitive data types is generally
possible (for example, \f[V]new Boolean\f[R], \f[V]new String\f[R] and
\f[V]new Number\f[R]).
.PP
If you really want to create a \f[V]Symbol\f[R] wrapper object, you can
use the \f[V]Object()\f[R] function:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
const sym = Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]);
typeof sym; // \[dq]symbol\[dq]
const symObj = Object(sym);
typeof symObj; // \[dq]object\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Because symbols are the only primitive data type that has reference
identity (that is, you cannot create the same symbol twice), they behave
like objects in some way.
For example, they are garbage collectable and can therefore be stored in
\f[V]WeakMap\f[R], \f[V]WeakSet\f[R], \f[V]WeakRef\f[R], and
\f[V]FinalizationRegistry\f[R] objects.
.SS Shared Symbols in the global Symbol registry
.PP
The above syntax using the \f[V]Symbol()\f[R] function will create a
Symbol whose value remains unique throughout the lifetime of the
program.
To create Symbols available across files and even across realms (each of
which has its own global scope), use the methods \f[V]Symbol.for()\f[R]
and \f[V]Symbol.keyFor()\f[R] to set and retrieve Symbols from the
global Symbol registry.
.PP
Note that the \[lq]global Symbol registry\[rq] is only a fictitious
concept and may not correspond to any internal data structure in the
JavaScript engine \[em] and even if such a registry exists, its content
is not available to the JavaScript code, except through the
\f[V]for()\f[R] and \f[V]keyFor()\f[R] methods.
.PP
The method \f[V]Symbol.for(tokenString)\f[R] takes a string key and
returns a symbol value from the registry, while
\f[V]Symbol.keyFor(symbolValue)\f[R] takes a symbol value and returns
the string key corresponding to it.
Each is the other\[cq]s inverse, so the following is \f[V]true\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
Symbol.keyFor(Symbol.for(\[dq]tokenString\[dq])) === \[dq]tokenString\[dq]; // true
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Because registered symbols can be arbitrarily created anywhere, they
behave almost exactly like the strings they wrap.
Therefore, they are not guaranteed to be unique and are not garbage
collectable.
Therefore, registered symbols are disallowed in \f[V]WeakMap\f[R],
\f[V]WeakSet\f[R], \f[V]WeakRef\f[R], and \f[V]FinalizationRegistry\f[R]
objects.
.SS Well-known Symbols
.PP
All static properties of the \f[V]Symbol\f[R] constructor are Symbols
themselves, whose values are constant across realms.
They are known as \f[I]well-known Symbols\f[R], and their purpose is to
serve as \[lq]protocols\[rq] for certain built-in JavaScript operations,
allowing users to customize the language\[cq]s behavior.
For example, if a constructor function has a method with
\f[V]Symbol.hasInstance\f[R] as its name, this method will encode its
behavior with the \f[V]instanceof\f[R] operator.
.PP
Prior to well-known Symbols, JavaScript used normal properties to
implement certain built-in operations.
For example, the \f[V]JSON.stringify\f[R] function will attempt to call
each object\[cq]s \f[V]toJSON()\f[R] method, and the \f[V]String\f[R]
function will call the object\[cq]s \f[V]toString()\f[R] and
\f[V]valueOf()\f[R] methods.
However, as more operations are added to the language, designating each
operation a \[lq]magic property\[rq] can break backward compatibility
and make the language\[cq]s behavior harder to reason with.
Well-known Symbols allow the customizations to be \[lq]invisible\[rq]
from normal code, which typically only read string properties.
.PP
In MDN and other sources, well-known symbol values are stylized by
prefixing \f[V]\[at]\[at]\f[R].
For example, \f[V]Symbol.hasInstance\f[R] is written as
\f[V]\[at]\[at]hasInstance\f[R].
This is because symbols don\[cq]t have actual literal formats, but using
\f[V]Symbol.hasInstance\f[R] does not reflect the ability of using other
aliases to refer to the same symbol.
This is like the difference between \f[V]Function.name\f[R] and
\f[V]\[dq]Function\[dq]\f[R].
.PP
Well-known symbols do not have the concept of garbage collectability,
because they come in a fixed set and are unique throughout the lifetime
of the program, similar to intrinsic objects such as
\f[V]Array.prototype\f[R], so they are also allowed in
\f[V]WeakMap\f[R], \f[V]WeakSet\f[R], \f[V]WeakRef\f[R], and
\f[V]FinalizationRegistry\f[R] objects.
.SS Finding Symbol properties on objects
.PP
The method \f[V]Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()\f[R] returns an array of
Symbols and lets you find Symbol properties on a given object.
Note that every object is initialized with no own Symbol properties, so
that this array will be empty unless you\[cq]ve set Symbol properties on
the object.
.SH Constructor
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]Symbol()\f[R]
.RS 2
.IP \[bu] 2
Creates a new \f[V]Symbol\f[R] object.
It is not a constructor in the traditional sense, because it can only be

.RE
.SH Static properties
.PP
The static properties are all well-known Symbols.
In these Symbols\[cq] descriptions, we will use language like
\[lq]\f[V]Symbol.hasInstance\f[R] is a method determining\&...\[rq], but
bear in mind that this is referring to the semantic of an object\[cq]s
method having this Symbol as the method name (because well-known Symbols
act as \[lq]protocols\[rq]), not describing the value of the Symbol
itself.

.SS Using the typeof operator with Symbols

The \f[V]typeof\f[R] operator can help you to identify Symbols.

.SS Symbol type conversions
.PP
Some things to note when working with type conversion of Symbols.
.IP \[bu] 2
When trying to convert a Symbol to a number, a \f[V]TypeError\f[R] will
be thrown (e.g.\ \f[V]+sym\f[R] or \f[V]sym | 0\f[R]).
.IP \[bu] 2
When using loose equality, \f[V]Object(sym) == sym\f[R] returns
\f[V]true\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]Symbol(\[dq]foo\[dq]) + \[dq]bar\[dq]\f[R] throws a
\f[V]TypeError\f[R] (can\[cq]t convert Symbol to string).
This prevents you from silently creating a new string property name from
a Symbol, for example.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \[lq]safer\[rq] \f[V]String(sym)\f[R] conversion works like a call
to \f[V]Symbol.prototype.toString()\f[R] with Symbols, but note that
\f[V]new String(sym)\f[R] will throw.
.SS Symbols and for\&...in iteration
.PP
Symbols are not enumerable in \f[V]for...in\f[R] iterations.
In addition, \f[V]Object.getOwnPropertyNames()\f[R] will not return
Symbol object properties, however, you can use
\f[V]Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()\f[R] to get these.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
const obj = {};

obj[Symbol(\[dq]a\[dq])] = \[dq]a\[dq];
obj[Symbol.for(\[dq]b\[dq])] = \[dq]b\[dq];
obj[\[dq]c\[dq]] = \[dq]c\[dq];
obj.d = \[dq]d\[dq];
