  // Each SpeechRecognitionResult object contains SpeechRecognitionAlternative objects
  // that contain individual results.
  // These also have getters so they can be accessed like arrays.
  // The second [0] returns the SpeechRecognitionAlternative at position 0.
  // We then return the transcript property of the SpeechRecognitionAlternative object
