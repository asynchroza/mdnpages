.SH NAME
Location.replace \- Location: replace() method
.SH SYNOPSIS
The \f[B]\f[CB]replace()\f[B]\f[R] method of the \f[CR]Location\f[R]
interface replaces the current resource with the one at the provided
URL.
The difference from the \f[CR]assign()\f[R] method is that after using
\f[CR]replace()\f[R] the current page will not be saved in session
\f[CR]History\f[R], meaning the user won\[cq]t be able to use the
\f[I]back\f[R] button to navigate to it.
.PP
If the assignment can\[cq]t happen because of a security violation, a
\f[CR]DOMException\f[R] of the \f[CR]SECURITY_ERROR\f[R] type is thrown.
This happens if the origin of the script calling the method is different
from the origin of the page originally described by the
\f[CR]Location\f[R] object, mostly when the script is hosted on a
different domain.
.PP
If the provided URL is not valid, a \f[CR]DOMException\f[R] of the
\f[CR]SYNTAX_ERROR\f[R] type is thrown.
